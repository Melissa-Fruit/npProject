          <img id ="images" src="../public/css/images/miniCat.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>There's no doubt that we love our pets very much. However, a local research has revealed a shocking figure regarding cat care, and it does raise a critical question: Is the welfare of Malaysian cats being taken care of?

The study shows that 40% of cat owners in Malaysia have never taken their pet to the vet.

This gap usually starts at the early stages of a cat's life, with only 10% of owners taking their new kitten to the vet. And yet, veterinarian visits during kittenhood is one of the key elements in providing them a great start to life.

Getting your kitten familiar with veterinary visits can lead to a more pleasant experience for both the owner and the cat in the years to come.

Prevention of diseases

Taking cats to the vet and starting when they are kittens is critical in the prevention of diseases.

Preventative healthcare, which includes prevention, early detection and reducing the impact of disease, is essential for catsâ€™ health and well-being.

This becomes more essential as the discovery of signs indicating a health decline in cats can be quite challenging even for seasoned cat owners.</p>
